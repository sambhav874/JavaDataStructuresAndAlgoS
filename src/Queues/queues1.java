//Queue can be used when elements donâ€™t have to be processed immediately, but on the first come first serve basis.

//This property of Queue makes it useful in different kinds of scenarios like:
//
//Network Printer
//
//Shared resource usage (CPU, memory access, etc.)
//
//Handling calls in call centers
